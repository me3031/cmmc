The following table provides a list of practice statement and objectives, and Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations to enable you to meet these requirements with Microsoft Entra ID.

|CMMC practice statement and objectives|Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|SC.L2-3.13.3  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Separate user functionality form system management functionality.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] user functionality is identified;  <br>[b.] system management functionality is identified; and  <br>[c.] user functionality is separated from system management functionality.|Maintain separate user accounts in Microsoft Entra ID for everyday productivity use and administrative or system/privileged management. Privileged accounts should be cloud-only or managed accounts and not synchronized from on-premises to protect the cloud environment from on-premises compromise. System/privileged access should only be permitted from a security hardened privileged access workstation (PAW). Configure Conditional Access device filters to restrict access to administrative applications from PAWs that are enabled using Azure Virtual Desktops.  <br>[Why are privileged access devices important](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/privileged-access-devices)  <br>[Device Roles and Profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-devices)  <br>[Filter for devices as a condition in Conditional Access policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-condition-filters-for-devices)  <br>[Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-desktop/)|
|SC.L2-3.13.4  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources is prevented.|Configure device management policies via MDM (such as Microsoft Intune), Configuration Manager, or group policy objects (GPO) to ensure devices are compliant with system hardening procedures. Include compliance with company policy regarding software patches to prevent attackers from exploiting flaws.  <br>  <br>Configure Conditional Access policies to enforce device compliance.  <br>  <br>**Conditional Access**  <br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>[Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>  <br>**InTune**  <br>[Device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)|
|SC.L2-3.13.13  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Control and monitor the use of mobile code.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] use of mobile code is controlled; and  <br>[b.] use of mobile code is monitored.|Configure device management policies via MDM (such as Microsoft Intune), Configuration Manager, or group policy objects (GPO) to disable the use of mobile code. Where use of mobile code is required monitor the use with endpoint security such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  <br>  <br>Configure Conditional Access policies to enforce device compliance.  <br>  <br>**Conditional Access**  <br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>[Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>  <br>**InTune**  <br>[Device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)  <br>  <br>**Defender for Endpoint**  <br>[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)|
