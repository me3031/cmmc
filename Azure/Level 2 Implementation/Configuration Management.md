|CMMC practice statement and objectives|Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|CM.L2-3.4.2  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational systems.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] security configuration settings for information technology products employed in the system are established and included in the baseline configuration; and  <br>[b.] security configuration settings for information technology products employed in the system are enforced.|Adopt a zero-trust security posture. Use Conditional Access policies to restrict access to compliant devices. Configure policy settings on the device to enforce security configuration settings on the device with MDM solutions such as Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Configuration Manager or group policy objects can also be considered in hybrid deployments and combined with Conditional Access require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device.  <br>  <br>**Zero-trust**  <br>[Securing identity with Zero Trust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity)  <br>  <br>**Conditional Access**  <br>[What is Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview)  <br>[Grant controls in Conditional Access policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>  <br>**Device policies**  <br>[What is Microsoft Intune?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)  <br>[What is Defender for Cloud Apps?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)  <br>[What is app management in Microsoft Intune?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/app-management)  <br>[Microsoft endpoint management solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/endpoint-manager-overview)|
|CM.L2-3.4.5  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to organizational systems.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined;  <br>[b.] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are documented;  <br>[c.] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved;  <br>[d.] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced;  <br>[e.] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined;  <br>[f.] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are documented;  <br>[g.] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved; and  <br>[h.] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced.|Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service. Customers don't have physical access to the Microsoft Entra datacenters. As such, each physical access restriction is satisfied by Microsoft and inherited by the customers of Microsoft Entra ID. Implement Microsoft Entra role based access controls. Eliminate standing privileged access, provide just in time access with approval workflows with Privileged Identity Management.  <br>[Overview of Microsoft Entra role-based access control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview)  <br>[What is Privileged Identity Management?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)  <br>[Approve or deny requests for Microsoft Entra roles in PIM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-approval-workflow)|
|CM.L2-3.4.6  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Employ the principle of least functionality by configuring organizational systems to provide only essential capabilities.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] essential system capabilities are defined based on the principle of least functionality; and  <br>[b.] the system is configured to provide only the defined essential capabilities.|Configure device management solutions (Such as Microsoft Intune) to implement a custom security baseline applied to organizational systems to remove non-essential applications and disable unnecessary services. Leave only the fewest capabilities necessary for the systems to operate effectively. Configure Conditional Access to restrict access to compliant or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined devices.  <br>[What is Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune)  <br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>[Grant controls in Conditional Access policy - Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)|
|CM.L2-3.4.7  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Restrict, disable, or prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.]essential programs are defined;  <br>[b.] the use of nonessential programs is defined;  <br>[c.] the use of nonessential programs is restricted, disabled, or prevented as defined;  <br>[d.] essential functions are defined;  <br>[e.] the use of nonessential functions is defined;  <br>[f.] the use of nonessential functions is restricted, disabled, or prevented as defined;  <br>[g.] essential ports are defined;  <br>[h.] the use of nonessential ports is defined;  <br>[i.] the use of nonessential ports is restricted, disabled, or prevented as defined;  <br>[j.] essential protocols are defined;  <br>[k.] the use of nonessential protocols is defined;  <br>[l.] the use of nonessential protocols is restricted, disabled, or prevented as defined;  <br>[m.] essential services are defined;  <br>[n.] the use of nonessential services is defined; and  <br>[o.] the use of nonessential services is restricted, disabled, or prevented as defined.|Use Application Administrator role to delegate authorized use of essential applications. Use App Roles or group claims to manage least privilege access within application. Configure user consent to require admin approval and don't allow group owner consent. Configure Admin consent request workflows to enable users to request access to applications that require admin consent. Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to identify unsanctioned/unknown application use. Use this telemetry to then determine essential/non-essential apps.  <br>[Microsoft Entra built-in roles - Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference)  <br>[Microsoft Entra App Roles - App Roles vs. Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps)  <br>[Configure how users consent to applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-user-consent?tabs=azure-portal.md)  <br>[Configure group owner consent to apps accessing group data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-user-consent-groups?tabs=azure-portal.md)  <br>[Configure the admin consent workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow)  <br>[What is Defender for Cloud Apps?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps)  <br>[Discover and manage Shadow IT tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/tutorial-shadow-it)|
