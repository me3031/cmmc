# Evolution of CMMC 

The introduction of CMMC 1.0 in early 2020 signaled the initiation of a standardized approach to safeguard the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) sector from cyber threats. This initial version established five levels of cybersecurity maturity, guiding organizations in the defense sector to adopt a certified approach to cybersecurity, thereby promoting a culture of awareness and readiness in cyber operations. 

  

Fast forward to November 2021, the Department of Defense introduced CMMC 2.0, simplifying the framework into three levels: foundational, advanced, and expert. The advanced level, which corresponds to the second level in this new framework, necessitates compliance with the practices and protocols defined in the NIST SP 800-171 standard. This aims to foster robust cyber hygiene, protecting organizations against a plethora of cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 

  

Level 2 of the CMMC 2.0, termed as the "advanced" level, is pivotal for organizations aiming to forge partnerships with the DoD. It mandates adherence to a higher standard of cybersecurity practices as outlined in the NIST SP 800-171, thereby ensuring fortified defense mechanisms are in place to counteract cyber threats. This level emerges as a critical benchmark for organizations to meet regulatory requisites and to nurture a strong infrastructure for cybersecurity. 

  

As we look at the larger industry landscape, CMMC is gradually cementing itself as an industry standard. The pathway to this involves an augmented focus on education and training to foster widespread understanding and compliance. The role of third-party assessments remains crucial, enabling organizations to gauge their existing cyber health and work progressively towards achieving the desired CMMC level. Moreover, the introduction of self-assessments in CMMC 2.0 allows organizations to actively participate and take charge of their cybersecurity readiness. Importantly, the DoD’s insistence on CMMC compliance for securing contracts has been a driving force behind organizations rallying to meet and uphold the CMMC standards, indicating that this framework is not just a regulatory mandate but a necessary stride towards business continuity and growth in the defense sector. 

  

Moving forward, it is anticipated that CMMC will continue to evolve, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and adapting to the changing dynamics of the cyber landscape. What stands clear is that Level 2 under the CMMC 2.0 framework will play a vital role for organizations to demonstrate a robust cybersecurity posture, effectively balancing attainability and security rigidity. The trajectory is pointed towards a secure and resilient industrial landscape where CMMC, with its layered approach to cybersecurity, is the gold standard in safeguarding vital information while fostering an environment of trust and readiness against cyber threats.

# Key Features

1. Structured Maturity Levels: Initially, the CMMC 1.0 had five levels, and now CMMC 2.0 has three: foundational, advanced, and expert. These levels provide a structured approach to cybersecurity, progressively increasing in complexity and security robustness. Understanding the distinctive features of each level and their respective requirements would be pivotal in a study. 
    

  

2. Adoption of NIST Standards: Both versions of CMMC have grounded their requirements in established NIST standards, such as NIST SP 800-171 and NIST SP 800-172. A study should deeply explore how CMMC has incorporated and built upon these standards to ensure a high level of cybersecurity hygiene in organizations. 
    

  

3. Self-Assessment and Third-Party Certifications: Under the CMMC 2.0 framework, organizations have the option to undertake self-assessments or to seek third-party certification. This dual approach aims to enhance accessibility and compliance, and a study should delve into the operational dynamics and effectiveness of this system. 
    

  

4. Protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): A crucial objective of the CMMC is to secure CUI within the industry's supply chain. Highlighting the strategies and practices endorsed by CMMC for the protection of CUI should be a central focus. 
    

  

5. Continuous Monitoring: The CMMC framework encourages organizations to adopt a posture of continuous monitoring to maintain a robust cybersecurity environment. Understanding the tools, techniques, and practices recommended for this should be integral in a study. 
    

  

6. Reciprocity with Other Security Frameworks: The CMMC AB is working towards fostering reciprocity with other security frameworks to alleviate the compliance burden on organizations. It would be essential to examine how this is being achieved and the potential benefits it brings. 
    

  

7. Comprehensive Coverage: CMMC covers a wide array of cybersecurity domains, encapsulated through various capabilities and practices. A detailed exploration of these domains and their relevance in contemporary cybersecurity landscapes should be a focus area. 
    

  

8. Industry Feedback and Evolution: The CMMC framework is designed to be dynamic, adapting based on feedback from industry stakeholders and changes in the cyber threat landscape. It would be pertinent to study how the framework has evolved over time, taking into account industry insights and feedback. 
    

  

9. Education and Training: CMMC 2.0 emphasizes education and training to foster compliance and readiness among DIB contractors. Analyzing the role and impact of educational initiatives under CMMC could be a significant aspect of a study. 
    

  

10. Global Expansion Plans: The DoD has indicated potential plans to extend the CMMC framework to allied nations. This aspect could be explored to understand how CMMC might shape global standards in cybersecurity.
