To satisfy the CMMC Maturity level 1 requirements of the System and Communication Protection (SC) control family; the following products of the Microsoft 365 E3 license will be used (each hyperlink will direct you to an overview of the product):

| Control | M365 Product | 
| ------- | ------------ |
| SC. L1-3.13.1 - Boundary Protection | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Conditional Access, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Plan 1, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, Windows Defender Firewall, Network Protection, Microsoft Intune | 
| SC. L1-3.13.5 - Public-Access System Separation | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure AD Multifactor Authentication, Conditional Access, Microsoft Intune | 

SC. L1-3.13.1 - Boundary Protection Control language: Monitor, control, and protect organizational communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems Determination statements: [a] the external system boundary is defined [b] key internal system boundaries are defined [c] communications are monitored at the external system boundary [d] communications are monitored at key internal boundaries [e] communications are controlled at the external system boundary [f] communications are controlled at key internal boundaries [g] communications are protected at the external system boundary[h] communications are protected at key internal boundaries. Control summary: The organization will need to detail system boundaries by identifying areas of entry and exit which exist on the information system. Once identified the organization will need to put access control measures and network traffic mechanisms in place to limit the internal connections to external resources as well as the external connections made to their resources. Microsoft 365 licensing needed: Microsoft 365 E3 licensing offers the following features to be leveraged to satisfy the requirements of this control: ▫ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Azure AD Premium Plan 1, Conditional Access ▫ Microsoft Defender for Endpoint- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1, Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, Network Protection ▫ Microsoft Intune How to implement using Microsoft 365: The organization will need to create documentation designed to outline the information and data flow on the network, as well as network diagrams that call out the external and key internal boundaries for assets access (e.g. cloud applications, endpoints, etc.) [a,b]. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes an endpoint firewall, Windows Defender Firewall, which will need to be enabled on the endpoint connecting to the information system using Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint offers Network protection capabilities which helps prevent access to dangerous web domains and application. Domains that host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet are considered dangerous. Network protection must be configured to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname) [c,d,g,h]. Using Azure AD and Microsoft Intune, the organization can create conditional access policies which make sure only authorized users and managed & compliant devices can access Microsoft 365 services such as email and Software as a service (SaaS) applications [e,f].

SC. L1-3.13.5- Public-Access System Separation Control language: Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks Determination statements: [a] publicly accessible system components are identified [b] subnetworks for publicly accessible system components are physically or logically separated from internal networks Control summary: For all organization resources which can be accessed by the public, there must be physical and/or logical separation created from network resources which house FCI. Logical separation can be enforced with boundary control mechanisms and techniques such as firewalls, routers, and gateways for on-premises infrastructure. Cloud based surfaces with identification and authentication mechanisms in place also create logical boundaries for the FCI which is stored within. Microsoft 365 licensing needed: Microsoft 365 E3 licensing offers the following features to be leveraged to satisfy the requirements of this control: ▫ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Azure AD Premium Plan 1, Conditional Access, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) ▫ Microsoft Intune How to implement using Microsoft 365: The organization will need to maintain a list of all controlled systems able to be accessed publicly and assure that those components are not attached to the same Microsoft 365 environment as FCI [a]. Using Azure AD and Microsoft Intune, the organization will need to set conditional access policies which restrict access to the information system to authorized users and devices. This creates a logical password and multifactor authentication protected boundary for access to the FCI environment [b].
