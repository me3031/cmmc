IA. L1-3.5.1 - Identification Control language: Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices. Determination statements: [a] system users are identified [b] processes acting on behalf of users are identified [c] devices accessing the system are identified Control summary: This control requires an organization to assign unique identifiers to users and devices authorized to access organizational assets. It also requires an automated process to be assigned to user IDs associated with the responsibility of the tasks the process is designed to perform. This is used to establish undeniable identification of the user, device, or process while it performs actions on organizational assets.

Microsoft 365 licensing needed: Microsoft 365 E3 licensing offers the following features to be leveraged to satisfy the requirements of this control: ▫ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)- Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 1 ▫ Microsoft Intune How to implement using Microsoft 365: The organization will establish and document a universal standard for user and device identifiers on the information system. This document will provide guidance for the creation of user accounts allowing them to be associated with a particular user and their actions. When the user account is created in Azure AD, the organization will create the user account using the established standard [a]. Any automated processes or scripts which act on behalf of users should be assigned to the user Azure AD which they are being performed in accordance with [b]. Devices authorized for access to resources will need to be enrolled in Microsoft Intune and assigned unique device ids in Azure AD [c].

IA. L1-3.5.2 - Authentication Control language: Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.

Determination statements: [a] the identity of each user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access [b] the identity of each process acting on behalf of a user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access [c] the identity of each device accessing or connecting to the system is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access Control summary: The organization will need to implement access control mechanisms which require any identity (user, device, process) attempting to access organizational resources to authenticate and verify their identity prior to access being granted to resources. Microsoft 365 licensing needed: Microsoft 365 E3 licensing offers the following features to be leveraged to satisfy the requirements of this control: ▫ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)- Azure AD Premium Plan 1, Azure AD Multifactor Authentication, Conditional Access ▫ Microsoft Intune How to implement using Microsoft 365: To satisfy this requirement the organization will need to use conditional access within Azure AD to create conditional access policies that require Azure MFA for all authorized user accounts as a prerequisite to access the information system [a]. Using Microsoft Intune to enroll devices and Azure AD to configure conditional access policies for user accounts, the organization can require that user accounts only connect to the information system with devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune [c]. At user sign-on, Azure AD will deny access to the user if the device being used to connect is not one enrolled with Microsoft Intune.

To comply with requirements AC.L1-3.1.1 and IA.L1 3.5.1 the organization would have to identify authorized processes executed by users. Processing acting on behalf of users (if present), which are assigned to user accounts, will require the attached user to identify and authenticate prior to access to the system [b,c].
