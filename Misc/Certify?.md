## **Why Is CMMC Important?**

Some of the most significant [cybersecurity attacks began by compromising a supply chain](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/cyber-attack-us-security-protocols). The Solar Wind compromise allowed cybercriminals to infiltrate the company’s customers. A known vulnerability in Microsoft’s Exchange Server allowed hackers to penetrate multiple instances, including government agencies. To mitigate the ongoing risk, the DoD established the CMMC process.

In [January 2020](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2071434/dod-to-require-cybersecurity-certification-in-some-contract-bids/), the DoD announced it would begin issuing requests for proposals or information in September 2020 that included the CMMC requirement. Organizations wanting to do business with the DoD must meet the CMMC requirements listed in their contract. At a minimum, all contractors must be certified at level one. If companies are unable to prove compliance, they will become ineligible for DoD contracts. Full implementation is expected in 2026.

The DoD’s budget for the [fiscal year 2022 is $715 billion](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2638711/the-department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2022-defense-budg/). Of that budget, [23% goes to small businesses](https://business.defense.gov/). In 2020, 45% of the DoD’s small business contractors went to disadvantaged and women-owned firms. No matter the size, companies wanting to contract with the DoD must ensure that they meet the CMMC requirements.
## **How to Become Certified**

Companies must first determine their level of compliance. The compliance level determines what standards must be met to achieve certification. The DoD provides a self-assessment tool to help companies prepare for an audit. Organizations must contact an accredited CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO) to schedule certification time. The C3PAO conducts an assessment and identifies any gaps in compliance. Businesses have 90 days to rectify the deficiencies to achieve certification. Cask is an authorized C3PAO company and is ready to support your organization.
