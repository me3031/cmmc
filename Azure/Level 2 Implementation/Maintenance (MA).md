|CMMC practice statement and objectives|Microsoft Entra guidance and recommendations|
|---|---|
|MA.L2-3.7.5  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is complete.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] multifactor authentication is used to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external network connections; and  <br>[b.] nonlocal maintenance sessions established via external network connections are terminated when nonlocal maintenance is complete.|Accounts assigned administrative rights are targeted by attackers, including accounts used to establish non-local maintenance sessions. Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) on those accounts is an easy way to reduce the risk of those accounts being compromised.  <br>[Conditional Access - Require MFA for administrators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa)|
|MP.L2-3.8.7  <br>  <br>**Practice statement:** Control the use of removable media on system components.  <br>  <br>**Objectives:**  <br>Determine if:  <br>[a.] the use of removable media on system components is controlled.|Configure device management policies via MDM (such as Microsoft Intune), Configuration Manager, or group policy objects (GPO) to control the use of removable media on systems. Deploy and manage Removable Storage Access Control using Intune, Configuration Manager, or Group Policy. Configure Conditional Access policies to enforce device compliance.  <br>  <br>**Conditional Access**  <br>[Require device to be marked as compliant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant)  <br>[Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant#require-hybrid-azure-ad-joined-device)  <br>  <br>**Intune**  <br>[Device compliance policies in Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)  <br>  <br>**Removable storage access control**  <br>[Deploy and manage Removable Storage Access Control using Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/deploy-manage-removable-storage-intune?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)  <br>[Deploy and manage Removable Storage Access Control using group policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/deploy-manage-removable-storage-group-policy?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)|
