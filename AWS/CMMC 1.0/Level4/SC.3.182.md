Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

##  dms-replication-not-public
[dms-replication-not-public](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dms-replication-not-public.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to the AWS Cloud by ensuring DMS replication instances cannot be publicly accessed. DMS replication instances can contain sensitive information and access control is required for such accounts.

##  ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check
[ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ebs-snapshot-public-restorable-check.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to the AWS Cloud by ensuring EBS snapshots are not publicly restorable. EBS volume snapshots can contain sensitive information and access control is required for such accounts.

##  restricted-ssh
[restricted-ssh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/restricted-ssh.html)

Guidance:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Security Groups can help manage network access by providing stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. Not allowing ingress (or remote) traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 on your resources help you restricting remote access.

##  internet-gateway-authorized-vpc-only
[internet-gateway-authorized-vpc-only](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/internet-gateway-authorized-vpc-only.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that internet gateways are only attached to authorized Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). Internet gateways allow bi-directional internet access to and from the Amazon VPC that can potentially lead to unauthorized access to Amazon VPC resources.

##  lambda-function-public-access-prohibited
[lambda-function-public-access-prohibited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-function-public-access-prohibited.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring AWS Lambda functions cannot be publicly accessed. Public access can potentially lead to degradation of availability of resources.

##  no-unrestricted-route-to-igw
[no-unrestricted-route-to-igw](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/no-unrestricted-route-to-igw.html)

Guidance:
Ensure Amazon EC2 route tables do not have unrestricted routes to an internet gateway. Removing or limiting the access to the internet for workloads within Amazon VPCs can reduce unintended access within your environment.

##  rds-instance-public-access-check
[rds-instance-public-access-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-instance-public-access-check.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances are not public. Amazon RDS database instances can contain sensitive information, and principles and access control is required for such accounts.

##  rds-snapshots-public-prohibited
[rds-snapshots-public-prohibited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-snapshots-public-prohibited.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances are not public. Amazon RDS database instances can contain sensitive information and principles and access control is required for such accounts.

##  redshift-cluster-public-access-check
[redshift-cluster-public-access-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/redshift-cluster-public-access-check.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Redshift clusters are not public. Amazon Redshift clusters can contain sensitive information and principles and access control is required for such accounts.

##  restricted-common-ports
[restricted-common-ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/restricted-common-ports.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring common ports are restricted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups. Not restricting access to ports to trusted sources can lead to attacks against the availability, integrity and confidentiality of systems. This rule allows you to optionally set blockedPort1 - blockedPort5 parameters (Config Defaults: 20,21,3389,3306,4333). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

##  s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic
[s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets cannot be publicly accessed. This rule helps keeping sensitive data safe from unauthorized remote users by preventing public access. This rule allows you to optionally set the ignorePublicAcls (Config Default: True), blockPublicPolicy (Config Default: True), blockPublicAcls (Config Default: True), and restrictPublicBuckets parameters (Config Default: True). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

##  s3-bucket-level-public-access-prohibited
[s3-bucket-level-public-access-prohibited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-level-public-access-prohibited.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets cannot be publicly accessed. This rule helps keeping sensitive data safe from unauthorized remote users by preventing public access at the bucket level.

##  s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
[s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by only allowing authorized users, processes, and devices access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. The management of access should be consistent with the classification of the data.

##  s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
[s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by only allowing authorized users, processes, and devices access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. The management of access should be consistent with the classification of the data.

##  sagemaker-notebook-no-direct-internet-access
[sagemaker-notebook-no-direct-internet-access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/sagemaker-notebook-no-direct-internet-access.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon SageMaker notebooks do not allow direct internet access. By preventing direct internet access, you can keep sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users.

##  ssm-document-not-public
[ssm-document-not-public](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ssm-document-not-public.html)

Guidance:
Ensure AWS Systems Manager (SSM) documents are not public, as this may allow unintended access to your SSM documents. A public SSM document can expose information about your account, resources and internal processes.

##  vpc-default-security-group-closed
[vpc-default-security-group-closed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-default-security-group-closed.html)

Guidance:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups can help in the management of network access by providing stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. Restricting all the traffic on the default security group helps in restricting remote access to your AWS resources.

##  vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports
[vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports.html)

Guidance:
Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring common ports are restricted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Security Groups. Not restricting access on ports to trusted sources can lead to attacks against the availability, integrity and confidentiality of systems. By restricting access to resources within a security group from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) remote access can be controlled to internal systems.
